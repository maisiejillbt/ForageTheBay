# Forage the Bay

## - Find what you can forage and where with Forage the Bay, a data visualization tool for foragers of all experience levels. 

With Forage the Bay you can easily find a food to forage in your area no matter the season! Forage the Bay is made up of data from my personal knowledge of the bay area as well as information from California State Parks and Forests. 
The main map in the center of the page can be easily interacted with, you can select your current season, and the area you want to visit, this will bring up information and regulations for your selected park as well as the available foods during that season. For more information and identification, I have included links to each foods wikipedia page.

1) A visual map that changes depending on the season selected / where you have clicked  
2) A right sidebar generated by data showing all available foods for that park/season
3) A left sidebar generated by data from park information 
4) The ability to add a food to a park / season
5) Can click on and interact with all food items
